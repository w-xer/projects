    <p>I am a student at Morgan Fitzgerald middle school. I went to Frontier Elementary for half a year of kindergareden to 5th grade. Now I am successfully moving onto 7th grade with good grades and new friends, and I hope that I will strengthen my relationships with some people and befriend people that I didn't talk to before. I hope 7th grade will be just as fun as 6th. My hobbies are reading, watching YouTube, and programming. My dream job is to work at Google and earn lots of money to buy designer bags and afford a nice home next to my family.
